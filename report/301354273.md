- Custom instance:

  Those instances are included in the custominstance folder and is for question 2.5. See detail below.

- 1.4 answer:

  - Agent 0 is at **(1,4)** at time step 10 in my solution.
  - Changes to the goal test condistion:
    I compute the maximal time step that constraint table contains, and then **add 
    another condition in goal test condition that current node time step must great than or equal to that time** in order to reutrn the solution path.

- 1.5 answer:

  - Constraints:

    ```C
    {'agent':1, 'loc':[(1,3), (1,2)], 'timestep':2}
    {'agent':1, 'loc':[(1,3), (1,3)], 'timestep':2}
    {'agent':1, 'loc':[(1,3), (1,4)], 'timestep':2}
    {'agent':1, 'loc':[(1,2)], 'timestep':1}
    ```

  - Solution:

    [[(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)], [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4)]]

  - Sum of path length: 8

- 2.4 answer:

  - what happened:

    There is infinite loop and my solver didn't terminate.

- 2.5 answer:

  - Instance that prioritized planning does not find an collision-free solution for a given ordering of agents:

    ```C
    5 7
    @ @ @ @ @ @ @
    @ @ . @ @ . @
    @ . . . . . @
    @ @ . @ @ . @
    @ @ @ @ @ @ @
    3
    1 2 2 5
    2 1 1 5
    3 2 3 5
    ```

    

  - Instance that prioritized planning does not find an collision-free solution, no matter which ordering of the agents it used:

    ```c
    5 7
    @ @ @ @ @ @ @
    @ @ . @ @ . @
    @ . . @ . . @
    @ @ . @ @ . @
    @ @ @ @ @ @ @
    3
    1 2 2 5
    2 1 1 5
    3 2 3 5
    ```

    

  - Instance that prioritized planning does not find an collision-free solution for a given ordering of the agents even if an ordering of the agents exists for which prioritized planning finds an optimal collision-free solution:

    ```C
    5 7
    @ @ @ @ @ @ @
    @ @ . @ @ . @
    @ . . . . . @
    @ @ . @ @ . @
    @ @ @ @ @ @ @
    3
    1 2 2 5
    2 1 1 5
    3 2 3 5
    ```
